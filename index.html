                     4 devs on the team, 2 had written some clojure before
                     2 had not, and had only o-o experience
                     I’d done some Scala and a bit of racket which is a lisp dialect
                     Obviously we were building a prototype that needed to evolve quickly.
                     There was no time to learn the language first
                     Had to learn as we went along

                     Found clojure really easy to pick up
                     Concise language
                     Like that extra features are added on in separate libraries not put into the core language
                     Good documentation
                     Not much code
                     Easy to read, easy to debug
                     http request and response are maps, so once you know what you can do with a map

                    is my app doing what i expect?
                    what happens when i execute this arbitrary code?
                    initially this second point helped me work out how to use the language
                    quicker feedback than unit test
                    and for that sort of thing you would end up deleting the test anyway

                     4 of us on the team, mostly pair programming
                     1 had used emacs, 1 vi, 2 of us neither
                     easier to use the same ide when you're pairing?
                     emacs has evil mode for our vi user
                     2 of us would have to learn something new anyway
                     although i’ve recently been hearing good things about cursive plugin for intellij
                     so decided to use emacs
                     much steeper learning curve than clojure
                     still struggled with it by the end
                     missed having an ide for small refactors and renames
                     by halfway felt like it wasn't actively blocking me getting things done
                     but also didn't feel like it was helping

                     there are many cheatsheets
                     whereas clojure has just one
                     much more complicated than the clojure cheatsheets!
                     and does not fit on one page!
                     i think if you want to get moving quickly with clojure, emacs at the same time maybe isn't the win

                <h1>reloaded workflow</h1>
                 <aside class="notes">
                     as well as cider we used stuart sierra's reloaded flow
                     this allows you to make a change to your source code, call (reset) in the repl, and see the change in your running app
                     it uses clojure.tools.namespace to work out which source files have changed
                     refreshes these in the running dev env
                 </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <pre><code class="clojure" data-trim>
(defonce candela nil)

(defn go []
  (alter-var-root #'candela
  (constantly (jetty/run-jetty (cweb/app config)))))

(defn stop []
  (.stop candela))

(defn reset []
  (stop)
  (repl/refresh :after 'user/go))
                </code></pre>
                 <aside class="notes">
                     so you define a reset function in user.clj
                     this is loaded by default when you start the repl
                     stops the running app
                     reloads changed namespaces
                     creates and starts the app again
                     all within the same jvm
                     so super fast
                     the other great thing about this, that you can’t really see from this example - is that we actually ended up with about 5 different web services that we were running at once.
                     The reloaded workflow meant that we could make a change to a bit of code that was used by more than one of the services, and by calling refresh, both would pick up the changes straightaway.
                     definitely recommend getting this working as soon as possible, we left it quite late
                     you just define a dev profile in your leingingen config
                     so the user.clj file is only used in dev
                     not deployed in the jar
                     and be careful about any global state in your application, because you want to be able to stop and start back up again easily
                     the only thing that was not so awesome with this, and we’ll talk more about this later
                     is when we wanted to change something on the ui
                     we used enlive for templating, and had jade files that produced html
                     when a jade or html file changed on disk it was not picked up by the reloaded flow
                     this was the only limitation we found

                    We started with just a service and an identity provider and explored this flow
                    So here the user would be redirected from the service directly to the identity provider
                    they would log in at the identity provider
                    then be redirected back to the service with their identity assured
                    this is by far the simplest flow
                    however it doesn’t scale that well
                    what if i want to use my login with the identity provider to access another government service?
                    or what if, like in gov uk verify, i want to have the choice between different identity providers?

                    Successful alpha in that we learnt a lot about the problem domain
                    didn't implement everything
                    but have good understanding of how the system could work
                    and different options of how it could be built
                    could see what would require further technical exploration
                    with the kerodon tests we have an expressive technical artifact
                    However, GDS are not building a beta

                    &ldquo;Remember that a primary goal during the alpha is learning.
                    We might not be ready to make the investment in creating production-ready systems.
                    In particular, that investment might be premature if the team learns they are not solving the right problem.&rdquo;

                     We found that the needs for organisation identity assurance are not the same across services
                     for example, ???
                     doesn't make sense for gds to build a govt wide thing
                     some services need fine grained perms, others don't
                     for example, in the wands service I can simply register wands, whereas in other services, for example an HMRC service to pay tax on behalf of my organisation, there may be some taxes I can pay, some I don’t have the authority to pay.
                     Also we found through user research that some services already have relationships established
                     if you’re the headmaster of hogwarts and have been registering wands for ten years with the ministry of magic you don't want to suddenly prove that you have the authority to do so

            <h2>would we use clojure for a similar project?</h2>
             <aside class="notes">
                 With a similar team, yes
                 probably even if the team had no experience in clojure
                 it is quick to pick up
                 this alpha set a very good precedent for using clojure at gds
                 Other TW prototypes have since been built in clojure
                 with non-clojure devs on the team
                 so it’s definitely the language we would choose for building prototypes where you need to evolve quickly
